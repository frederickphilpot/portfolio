            <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Frederick Philpot, a passionate web designer and developer with a journey rooted in creativity and technology. My exploration into web design began with a fascination for how digital spaces can blend aesthetics with functionality. Over the years, I've cultivated a skill set that spans across design principles, user experience, and front-end development.</p> 
            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p> My adventure into web design started in 2022 when I first encountered the power of HTML and CSS. What began as a hobby quickly evolved into a dedicated pursuit. I was captivated by the ability to transform ideas into visually engaging and interactive digital experiences. This initial spark ignited a commitment to mastering the craft of web design.</p>
